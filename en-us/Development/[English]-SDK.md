The PlatON SDK is a bridge for applications to access the PlatON network. It uses the RPC interface to interact with nodes. It mainly includes functions such as deployment contracts and call contracts, and cryptographic signature interfaces.

For developer use, PlatON provides SDKs in two languages: Java and JavaScript

| Type     | Guide | Project |
| -------- | ------------------- | ---------------------------|
| Java SDK | [Java SDK Development Guide](/en-us/Development/[English]-Java-SDK.md) | https://github.com/PlatONnetwork/client-sdk-java |
| JS SDK   | [JS SDK Development Guide](/en-us/Development/[English]-JS-SDK.md) | https://github.com/PlatONnetwork/client-sdk-js/  |

The main features of both language SDKs:

* JSON-RPC protocol communication with PlatON nodes.
* Smart contract deployment and invocation.
* Interface to PlatON economic model.
* Cryptographic signature interface.
* Wallet management.

Before using the PlatON SDK, if you need to set up a node to connect to the PlatON network or create a private network, please refer to:
