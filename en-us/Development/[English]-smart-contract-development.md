This guide introduces the development process of smart contracts and issues that need attention in the development process from the perspective of the developer. Guide developers to quickly develop high-quality smart contracts on the PlatON network.

### Smart Contract

A smart contract is a computer protocol designed to propagate, verify, or execute contracts in an informational manner. Smart contracts allow trusted transactions to be made without third parties, which are traceable and irreversible.

The smart contract contains all the information related to the transaction, and the result operation will be performed only after the requirements are met. The difference between smart contracts and traditional paper contracts is that smart contracts are computer-generated. The code itself therefore explains the relevant obligations of the parties.

In fact, participants in smart contracts are usually strangers on the Internet, subject to binding digital protocols. Essentially, a smart contract is a digital contract that will not produce results unless the requirements are met.


### Decentralized Applications

Decentralized application (DApp) is an application software that runs on a decentralized point-to-point network. Similar to current mobile applications, DApps are also a type of App. But it does not run on the IOS and Android platforms, but on the operating system of the blockchain network.

DApps are combined with the blockchain through smart contracts. Common DApps are composed of front-end, back-end, and smart contracts. The back-end of DApps can also be implemented through smart contracts. DAPP can communicate with PlatON network through PlatON SDK, and SDK can also interact with smart contracts.
