**[PlatScan](https://platscan.test.platon.network/)** is a Block Explorer and Analytics Platform for PlatON. It provides services for querying, browsing, and analyzing data on the PlatON Network blockchain ( Include testnet). You can query addresses, blocks, transactions, validators, governance proposals, and all other activities taking place on PlatON Network.

**Please note that PlatScan is not a wallet service provider. We do not store your private keys and we have no control over the transactions that take place over the PlatON Network.**

In this section we will give an overall introduction to PlatScan:

## Navigation bar

PlatScan currently supports the NewBaleyword Rally test network, and will subsequently support the main network and other test networks. You can enter the block height, address, block hash, transaction hash, validator name in the search box to query the specific information you need to browse. You can also click the navigation menu-Home, Blocks, Transactions, Validators, and Proposals to view more information on the PlatON Network blockchain.

## Home

"Home" provides a quick query entry. Support input "block height" and "block hash" to query block information, input "transaction hash" to query transaction information, input "account address" to query account information, and input "validator name" to query validator information.

Showed the basic situation of PlatON Network, including the running status of the chain, transaction data, circulation circulating supply and stake information, block list, and validators currently participating in consensus. Lets you quickly learn about PlatON Network.

## Account address details

You can enter it by querying the account address or the related account address link.

In the address details, you can understand the basic information of the account address, including the balance of the account address, the number of transactions associated with the address, the amount of stakes/ delegations, unclaimed reward and Invalid delegations(The amount of delegations in an invalid state. The delegations will not generate delegated rewards, and requires your active withdrawal).

![image-20200211182949261](PlatScan-user-manual.assets/image-20200211182949261.png)

If the current account address is participating in the restricted token program, the restricted balance is displayed. Click Restricted Balances to see detailed restricted balance information:

In the account address details, you can also browse in detail all the associated transaction information, delegated information, and details of delegated rewards that have been received for the account address.

**Transactions,** support browsing and downloading transaction information according to transaction classification. You can click on the blue link of the transaction hash to view detailed transaction information. Note that downloading transaction information requires Google security verification. You can download up to 30,000 pieces of data each time.

![image-20200211183035948](PlatScan-user-manual.assets/image-20200211183035948.png)

**Delegations**, you can view the current account address delegation statistics, including the total delegated amount, the number of validators that have been delegated, the number of delegated locks, and the number of unlocked delegates. At the same time, based on the delegated nodes, the delegation information of each node is shown in detail, including: the delegated nodes, the number of delegates (locked + unlocked delegates), and the locked delegates (the amount of delegated accounts whose accounts are locked under the node , Locked delegations can get delegated rewards), the number of unlocked delegations, the number of delegations to be redeemed, and the number of delegation rewards to be received.

![image-20200211183506095](PlatScan-user-manual.assets/image-20200211183506095.png)

**Reward Details**, based on the transaction history of delegated reward collection, shows the details of delegated reward collection in detail, so you can clearly understand the source of delegated reward.

## Contract details

You can enter it by querying the contract address or the related contract address link.

In the contract details, you can understand the basic information of the contract, including the contract balance, the number of transactions associated with the contract, the contract name, and the contract creation information.

You can also browse the contract-related transaction information in detail, as well as the contract type and the on-chain bytecode of the contract. We will continue to optimize it in the future to provide more data and analysis information.

### Validators

The validator shows the nodes currently maintaining the operation of the PlatON Network, participating in consensus verification, and the current staking and reward situation. You can learn the current stake activity, reward situation, and progress of the current settlement epoch through real-time stake information, reward information for this epoch, and the next settlement epoch.

>  Note: Block Reward - refers to the reward for block production for each block produced by the participating nodes in the current settlement epoch. Staking Reward - refers to the staking reward that each active node in the settlement block of the current settlement epoch will get. Each interval of 10750 blocks is a settlement epoch.

The validator list shows all the nodes currently participating in the PlatON Network network. You can query the validators you need to find by entering the validator name, and you can browse the list of nodes in different states by filtering.

From the list, you can intuitively understand the status of each validator, the stake and delegtate data, the number of delegators, the stability of the node (including the number of low block generation times, the number of double signings), the number of blocks generated, and the estimated validator annualized yield , And the estimated delegated annualized yield.
